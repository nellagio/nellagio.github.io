      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h4> Computer, mechanical and electrical projects have always been an been projects I've worked on. Growing up I built my own
        computers and as of recently I've moved from the hardware aspect to the software side of machines. Why I decided
        to pursue a coding boot camp reason was two-fold. I wanted to learn a further hone my computer programming skills while acquiring a certificate that I will turn into a
        career.
